Comcerto 2000 (LS1024A) SoC unofficial documentation

This document is an effort to document the Comcerto 2000 SoC from Mindspeed
technologies (rebranded as Freescale/NXP QorIQ LS1024A after acquisition by
Freescale, then by NXP).

The information in this document comes only from public sources, such as the
official public datasheet, datasheets from other chips using the same IP blocks,
GPL'd source code, and experimentation on real hardware.

The document is written in the txt2tags format (https://txt2tags.org/). You can
build the HTML version by installing txt2tags and running:

$ txt2tags c2000doc.t2t

This will generate the c2000doc.html file.

If you also have GNU make installed, you can also simply run:

$ make

It will re-generate the c2000doc.html file only if one of the .t2t files has
changed since the HTML was generated.
