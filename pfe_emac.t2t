== Ethernet MAC (EMAC) ==[pfe_emac]

The EMAC is a Cadence Gigabit Ethernet MAC IP.

A driver exist in mainline Linux, but it cannot be used directly with this EMAC
implementation as there is no CPU interface.

Each EMAC instance has a matching EGPI block which handles the the Rx and Tx
queues. The EGPI blocks make use of the BMU blocks to allocate/free buffers
from the buffer pools.
